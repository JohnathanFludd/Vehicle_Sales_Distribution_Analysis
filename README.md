# Vehicle_Sales_Distribution_Analysis
A vehicle sales distribution analysis using SQL and Tableau

In this project, I explore a sales dataset and generate various analytics and insights from customers' past purchase behavior. I go from analyzing sales revenue to creating a customer segmentation analysis using the RFM technique. I go from basic SQL queries to exploring complex problems using the following skills:

- Importing a file into SQL Server Database
- SQL Aggregate Functions
- SQL Window Functions
- SQL Sub Query
- Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
- SQL XML Path Function
- Tableau
